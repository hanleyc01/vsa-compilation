# Introduction to Compilation with VSAs.


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is a primer for the thinking and intuitions behind encoding and
interpreting programming languages in Vector-Symbolic Architectures
(VSAs), based on Tomkins-Flanagan, *et al.* (2024) and Hanley, *et al.*
(2025).

We will begin with a short introduction to VSAs, as well as how we can
represent syntax with them. Then, we will do a discussion over
programming language semantics, and converting these functions to work
over high-dimensional vectors. We will then provide two concrete
examples: an implementation of an interpreter for a small subset of
LISP, as well as an implementation for a FORTH interpreter.
