    "$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fruit}}$ is the *minimal* set of *formulas* which have \n",
    "the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Atomic formulae**: For atomic symbols $\\mathcal{A} = \\{\\texttt{apple}, \\texttt{banana}, \n",

    "Atomic symbols like these are the most basic units of our language. E.g., if\n",
    "we are talking about the language of propositional logic, then the atomic\n",
    "values are the propositional variables $p, q, r, \\dots$. But, when talking\n",
    "about VSAs, we think it to be best practice to talk about delicious treats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compound formulae**: If $\\phi \\in \\mathcal{L}_\\text{fruit}$, and \n",

    "Compound statements are defined inductively over *all* the possible elements\n",
